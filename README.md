# HOSTING STATIC WEBSITE ON AWS SIMPLE STORAGE SERVICE (S3)
## Introduction
Hosting a static website on the cloud has become a popular choice for many individuals and businesses today. It offers scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness that traditional hosting options can't match. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides an excellent platform for hosting static websites through its Simple Storage Service (S3).



*A static website is a website that consists of fixed web pages that are displayed to the user exactly as they were created. These web pages are typically created using HTML, CSS, and other front-end web development technologies. Unlike dynamic websites, which generate content on the fly using server-side scripting languages, static websites have pre-built pages that are stored on a server and sent to the user's web browser upon request.*

**Some Benefits of Using S3 and Route 53 for Hosting the Website**
+ Cost-effective: Amazon S3 and Route 53 are both very cost-effective solutions for hosting static websites. You only pay for the storage and bandwidth that you use, and there are no upfront costs or minimum fees.

+ Scalability: S3 and Route 53 are both highly scalable services, meaning they can easily handle a large volume of traffic and data without any performance issues.

+ Reliability: Both services offer high availability and durability, with multiple backups and redundancies built in to ensure your website is always accessible.

+ Security: S3 and Route 53 both offer robust security features, such as encryption at rest and in transit, access control, and data protection.

+ Easy to use: Setting up and managing a static website on S3 and Route 53 is relatively easy and straightforward, even for non-technical users.

+ Custom domain support: Route 53 makes it easy to map your custom domain name to your S3 bucket, allowing you to use your own branded domain for your static website.



In this project, I will be focusing on how to host a static website on S3 and link it to a domain name purchased from GoDaddy.com. Additionally, we'll be using Amazon Route 53 to create a hosted zone for our domain name, which will allow us to map our domain name to the S3 bucket hosting our website.

This project will provide you with a step-by-step guide to creating and configuring your S3 bucket, setting up your hosted zone on Route 53, and linking the two together to create a functional website. We'll also cover some best practices for optimizing your website's performance and security on AWS.

Whether you're a developer looking to learn more about cloud hosting or a business owner seeking a reliable and cost-effective hosting solution, this project is an excellent starting point. So, let's get started and build a great static website on AWS!
